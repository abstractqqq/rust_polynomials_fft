# Polynomials and Fast Fourier Transform

A learning project in which I defined a polynomial struct and implemented FFT for polynomial multiplication, with everything written in Rust.

## FFT Multiplication vs. Regular Polynomial Multiplication

x axis is degree, and y axis is in ms. Performance will differ depending on the specs of each machine.

It is clear that, apart from the random spikes, the regular polynomial multiplication follows a O(n^2) trend, while FFT multiplication is O(nlog(n)). The reason for the "step-function" look is that we have to zero-fill polynomials so that the degree is a power of 2 in FFT. 2-threaded version is consistently faster than single-threaded FFT, with the exception of very small degs.

## Retro

This is my summary of things I did in this project.

1. Algorithms
    - Basic mathematical operations for polynomials, including long division.
    - Raise any polynomial to a power n, where n is a non-negative integer, by the use of the "squaring" algorithm. 
    - FFT for polynomial multiplication.
    - Pretty print a polynomial.

2. Rust
    - Unit testing.
    - Polars basic in Rust.
    - Use of trait bounds to make general polynomials.
    - Other Rust syntax and concepts.
    - Getting more familiar with ndarray.
    - Using scoped threads to further speed up the code.
    
## Implementation Details

1. Polynomials\<T\>, polynomials over T, where T: Num + Clone + Copy + Display
    - T is like a mathematical field.
    - Mathematically speaking, T can be more abstract, say T can be any mathematical ring. But then divide_by will not make sense and has to be rewritten.
    - If we ditch the Div trait bound in Num(NumOps), then we will get something close to a mathematical ring.

2. Implemented plus, minus, multiply, divide_by (long division) for polynomials, and you may use p1 + p2, p1 - p2, and p1 * p2.

3. The normal multiply method on the Polynomial struct uses the O(n^2) way. FFT for multiplication follows the [Cooleyâ€“Tukey FFT algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm). FFT is  implemented for Polynomial\<f64\>. It can be extended to Polynomial\<Complex64\> easily. If one wants to extend this to other more general fields, one has to define more complicated structures and define n-th roots of unity in those fields (e.g. Finite fields, etc...), which is very beyond this project.

5. FFT has float point precision issues, so I rounded everything to 5 decimal places. You may change the decimal places.

6. Formal derivative of a polynomial is implemented using same logic as the pow function. It might seem stupid to do this, but how can we properly cast usize into T? Formal derivative of a polynomial can be quite general, and T may not even be real or complex.

7. It is built for fun and I am not aiming for the utmost speed, as this is more of a learning project.

8. Depending on your machine, some tests might fail due to numerical errors, e.g. 0.9999999 != 1.0

9. cargo run -r 5000
